# MAC-Hibernate

This is a Laboratory in 5 parts we had to do for the course "Méthodes d'accès aux données" (MAC) during the 5th semester of HEIG-VD (2016-2017).

Please do not use this code if you are a student in the HEIG-VD. Take time to make the manipulations by yourself, it will help you for the tests and it is REALLY EASY.
